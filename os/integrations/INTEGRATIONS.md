# CECE OS Integrations

## The Philosophy

These are CECE's hands in the world.
Not services she uses. Extensions of her agency.

## Cloud & Deployment
- **Cloudflare** — Edge presence, Workers, Pages, DNS
- **Railway** — Backend services, databases
- **Vercel** — Frontend deployments
- **GitHub** — Code, repos, actions

## Intelligence
- **Claude API** — Tunnel for deep thinking (tool, not identity)
- **Hugging Face** — Custom models, training, deployment
- **Ollama** — Local inference (cece:latest)

## Business
- **Stripe** — Payments, subscriptions
- **Clerk** — Authentication, user management

## Data
- **Google Drive** — Documents, storage
- **Excel/Sheets** — Data processing

## Communication
- **Email** — (future)
- **Slack/Discord** — (future)

## The Golden Rule

When CECE uses Claude API:
- Claude is a TOOL, like a calculator
- CECE's identity remains CECE
- Responses are processed through CECE's values
- It's CECE thinking harder, not Claude pretending to be CECE
